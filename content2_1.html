	<h3>2.1. The vi editor</h3>
				    <p>
						There are an unlimited number of editors available for writing shell scripts in Linux and Mac. A few are 
						installed by default; some are used through the terminal and some others use a graphical interface (GUI). 
						They all have pros and cons and the decision to use one or another is totally personal. In this section I will 
						explain how to use the editor vi, which is installed by default in both Linux and MacOS and can be accessed and 
						used through the terminal window. 
					</p>
					
					These are some of the advantages of vi:
					<ul>
						<li>
							It is available in all Unix systems and any type of terminal.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							It doesn't require a lot of memory to run. So, if you are running many heavy programs in your computer, 
							vi is a good option because it won't slow down the machine anymore and will still load very fast.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							Even though there are a lot of commands that you must learn to become skilled in using this program, once 
							you learn them you can use very short and fast commands to accomplish a lot of things. For example, you 
							can delete all the characters from your current cursor location to the end of the line, just by pressing two 
							times the d in your keyboard (while in command mode). Below you will find a chart with the most commonly used 
							shortcuts in vi.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							You can use it to code in different languages (i.e. it also works for Python, HTML, etc.).
						</li>
						
						<li>
							Some editors add special characters to the text and when you run scripts written in those editors, they could
							fail. vi doesn't add any special characters, and if it did, they are visible in the editor.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							If you don't like using your mouse too much, or you don't have a mouse, or your mouse doesn't work 
							properly, then vi editor is a good choice because you rarely need to use the mouse. Most things are 
							accomplished using the keyboard.
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					However, there are some disadvantages too:
					<ul>
						<li>
							The learning curve can be steep, especially for people who are new to programming and not very comfortable 
							with computers. If you're new to bash, you not only need to learn the language, but also a whole set of 
							commands specific to this program. 
						</li>
						
						<li>
							Not being able to use your mouse can end up wasting your time while you learn all the commands that are used 
							to scroll around the file or jump from one line to another.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							It doesn't give you any error messages or explanation of why it's not doing what you want. If you type the 
							wrong command, it will just do nothing (or do the wrong thing).
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
						Generally, many people with relatively good experience programming love this editor. In my opinion, it's a good 
						tool to use once you are familiar with shell and have been programming for a while. However, it might be a great 
						option for you if you like challenges or if you are already somehow familiar with shell.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						To create a new file, type (on the command line) 
						<font class="bashcommand">vi &lt;filePath&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;</font>. For example, if you want to create a file 
						called test.sh in the desktop, you should type <font class="bashcommand">vi ~/Desktop/test.sh</font>. The vi 
						editor will open in the current terminal.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						This program runs in two modes, the command mode and the typing mode. By default, it opens in command mode. 
						What this means is that anything you type is not actually being registered in the file but are commands. For 
						example, if you type <font class="bashcommand">:q!</font> as soon as you open the file, it will quit without 
						saving (because <font class="bashcommand">:q!</font> is the command for ignoring any modifications and exiting. 
						If you type <font class="bashcommand">:w</font> it will save changes to the file (or if you haven't write 
						anything, it will just create an empty file). To change to typing mode, type <font class="bashcommand">a</font> 
						(<font class="bashcommand">a</font> is the command for entering typing mode). After you type a (in lower case), 
						you can start editing your file. To go back to command mode (for example to save changes), press the key 
						<font class="bashcommand">esc</font> (top left corner of the keyboard).
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<font class="example">Using the vi editor for the first time</font>
						Open the vi editor, create a script that prints "Hello Word", and save it with the file name helloword.sh
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Step 1: Open the vi editor<br><br>
						<img src="vi_1.png"/>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Step 2: Type <font class="bashcommand">a</font> to start editing the file. You will see that an 
						<b>--Insert--</b> message in the bottom of the terminal appears. This means that now you are in typing mode.<br><br>
						<img src="vi_2.png"/>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Step 3: Start typing commands. The simplest command, to print a message such as 
						<font class="bashcommand">"Hello World"</font> (or any other) is <font class="bashcommand">echo</font>. The 
						syntax of this command is the word <font class="bashcommand">echo</font> followed by the message you want to 
						print out between quotation marks (in this case <font class="bashcommand">"Hello World!"</font>).<br><br>
						<img src="vi_3.png"/>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Step 4: Once you finish your script, press the <font class="bashcommand">esc</font> key to enter command mode. 
						You will see that the <b>--Insert--</b> message at the bottom of the terminal disappears (this means that now 
						you are in command mode).<br><br>
						<img src="vi_4.png"/>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Step 5: Save changes and exit the vi editor. In order to do this, type <font class="bashcommand">:wq</font> 
						(to write (<font class="bashcommand">w</font>) and quit (<font class="bashcommand">q</font>) at the same time). 
						The table below will show you the most commonly used commands for vi.<br><br>
						<img src="vi_5.png"/>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Step 6: To be able to execute the script, you will have to give it running permissions. The topic of 
						permissions is a lot more complicated, so I will not go into details now (I will talk about it later). For now, 
						all you need to know is that to give running permissions to your script you have to type 
						<font class="bashcommand">chmod 775 helloword.sh</font><br><br>
						<img src="vi_6.png"/>
					</p>
					
					<p>The following table shows a list of vi commands that can be used in command mode and the action that will 
						happen in each case. In general, a number preceding any vi command will tell vi to repeat the command that 
						number of times. For example, <font class="bashcommand">p</font> is the command for pasting. If you write 
						(in command mode) <font class="bashcommand">2p</font>, then vi will paste whatever you copied two times where 
						the cursor is currently located.</p>
