		<h2><a href="bash.html" target="_blank">Bash Programming</a></h2>
		<p>
			This is a comprehensive tutorial that contains from very basic topics for people that has never programmed in bash
			(editors, variables, arrays, math operations, etc), to more complex things such as files, images and video manipulation, 
			creating and submitting jobs in a cluster, backups, permissions, etc.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The first chapters cover the most basic concepts and increase in complexity and difficulty as you advance through 
			the tutorial. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to do almost anything you want in bash.
		</p>
		
		<p>	
			The contents are targeted to any bash programmer, but also contain examples specific for neuroimagers. These examples
			will always be in a separate box. If you are a bash programmer but do not do any MRI analysis, you can ignore those
			parts of the tutorial.
