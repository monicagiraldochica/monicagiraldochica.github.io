	<h3>2.4. Running a script</h3>
					<p>
						Lala cosito5. Running a shell script is easy. You only type the path and name of the file in the command line and then press 
						enter. For example, if your script is located in the Desktop and is called helloWord.sh, then to execute it 
						you should type the following in the command line:<br>
						<font class="bashcommand">$ ~/Desktop/helloWord.sh</font><br><br>
						If you get a Permission Denied error, this means that you must change its permissions to make it runnable. 
						The topic of permissions is a bit complicated and will be explained in detail in chapter 12. But for now, you 
						only need to know that the following command will allow you to execute the script if it's not runnable:<br>
						<font class="bashcommand">$ chmod 775 &lt;script_path_and_name&gt;</font>
