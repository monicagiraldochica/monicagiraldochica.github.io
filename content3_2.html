<h3>3.2. Rules for assigning variable names</h3>
					<p>You can assign any value to a variable. However, a variable cannot have just any name. There are a few 
					rules for assigning variable names.</p>
					
					<ol>
						<li>
							A variable name should not be a number.<br>
							This type of variable is only used to read arguments on a shell script. For example, 
							<font class="bashcommand">$1</font> refers to the first argument of a script, 
							<font class="bashcommand">$2</font> to the second argument, etc. Later you will learn the meaning and use 
							of script arguments.
						</li><br>
						
						<li>
							Variable names must start with an alphabetical letter or an underscore.<br>
							Variable names can contain any number, but it should not be located at the beginning.
						</li><br>
						
						<li>
							Do not use <font class="bashcommand">$</font> or <font class="bashcommand">${}</font> to declare a 
							variable. These characters are used only to reference variables (not to declare).
						</li><br>
						
						<li>
							Do <u>NOT</u> assign the name <font class="bashcommand">PATH</font> to any variable.<br>
							If you do so, you won't get any error right away. But it will mess up the execution of other programs. 
							<font class="bashcommand">PATH</font> is a system variable that specifies a set of directories where 
							executable programs are located. For example, when you install a software that runs in the command line 
							(i.e. FSL), the path to the executable of that program will be included in the system variable 
							<font class="bashcommand">PATH</font>. So, if you rename that variable, you won't be able to execute the 
							program again in the current terminal. If you forget about this rule and mistakenly re-write the value 
							of this variable, close the current terminal and open a new one. Every time you open a new terminal, 
							this system variable will be re-set to the correct value (which is stored in the bash_profile, we will 
							talk about this file in a later chapter). At any moment you can know the value of your 
							<font class="bashcommand">PATH</font> by typing <font class="bashcommand">echo ${PATH}</font>. You will 
							see something like this (although this will significantly varies between one computer and the other 
							depending which programs you have installed and referenced in the bash_profile):<br><br>
							
							<font class="bashcommand">
							$ echo ${PATH}<br>
							<font class="bashcommand-result">/usr/local/fsl/bin:/Applications/freesurfer/bin:/Applications/freesurfer/fsfast/bin:/Applications/freesurfer/tktools:/usr/local/fsl/bin:/Applications/freesurfer/mni/bin:/Users/bunbury/bin:/Applications/MATLAB_R2018a.app/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin</font>
							</font><br><br>
							
							Another Unix reserved name that you should not use is <font class="bashcommand">BASH</font>. There is a long list 
							of Unix reserved words that I will not include here but you will learn as you get more experienced.
						</li><br>
						
						<li>
							Avoid using the following reserved characters from appearing in variable names:
							<font class="bashcommand">/ &gt; &lt; | : &amp; . *</font>	
						</li><br><br>
						
						<font class="example">Some valid and invalid variable names</font><br>
						<table>
							<caption>Valid and invalid variable names</caption>
							<tr>
								<th style="width:50%"><b>Valid variable names</b></th>
								<th style="width:50%"><b>Invalid variable names</b></th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>V</td>
								<td>1</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>VAR</td>
								<td>1VAR</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>VAR1</td>
								<td>2_VAR</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>VAR_1</td>
								<td>.VAR</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>_VAR1</td>
								<td>$VAR</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>_1VAR</td>
								<td>${VAR}</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>VARIABLE_NAME</td>
								<td>{VAR}</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>PATH1</td>
								<td>PATH</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>BASH1</td>
								<td>BASH</td>
							</tr>
						</table>
						
						<p>
							Variable names can be in lower and/or upper case. However, they are case sensitive. If you declare a 
							variable as <font class="bashcommand">VAR1</font>, but you reference it as 
							<font class="bashcommand">${var1}</font>, bash will not recognize the value. You must reference it as 
							<font class="bashcommand">${VAR1}</font>.
						</p>
