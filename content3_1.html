<h3>3.1. Utility, declaration and accessing variables</h3>
		    		<p>
						A very important aspect of programming (in bash or any other language) is the ability to use a label (called 
						variable) to indicate some other quantity (a number, character, string or command). For example, I can use 
						the variable <font class="bashcommand">${desktop}</font> to represent the string 
						<font class="bashcommand">"/Users/monica/Desktop"</font>. Or the variable 
						<font class="bashcommand">${year}</font> to represent the number <font class="bashcommand">2020</font> 
						(after correctly declaring these variables). Variables can be used for many purposes, including making the 
						code more readable, short and organized and to prevent typing errors. They are also very useful in cases in 
						which the actual value of a variable is not known before executing the program, or when you need to save the 
						output of one command to use as input for another command. For example, when reading the contents of a file 
						you can read line by line in an iterative manner (which you will learn later), saving each line in a variable 
						and then doing something with it (depending the purpose of the program). 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The easy thing about declaring variables in bash is that you don't have to specify data types. However, if 
						the value that you are assigning is a string of characters, you should use quotation marks 
						(<font class="bashcommand">"</font>) between the beginning and the end of your string (especially if the 
						string contains spaces). You must also be careful to not include any white space between the variable name, 
						the equals sign, and the value. Additionally, be aware that the quotation marks used in bash are 
						<font class="bashcommand">"</font>, which is different than those used in Microsoft Word. They look very 
						similar, but bash won't recognize the later ones. So, if you copy-paste from Microsoft Word a command that
						includes quotation marks, you will probably get an error.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<font class="example">Declaring variables of different data types</font>
						In the following commands, I will assign a number to the variable <font class="bashcommand">YEAR</font>, a String 
						to the variables <font class="bashcommand">MONTH</font> and <font class="bashcommand">NAME</font> and a character to 
						the variable <font class="bashcommand">GENDER</font>. As you can observe, numbers, strings and characters should 
						be declared in a different manner.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<font class="bashcommand">
						$ YEAR=2018<br>
						$ MONTH="August"<br>
						$ NAME="Monica Keith"<br>
						$ GENDER='F'
						</font>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<font class="example">Common mistakes when declaring variables</font>
						The following commands will produce errors because there is a white space before and/or after the equal sign 
						(<font class="bashcommand">=</font>), or because the quotation marks (<font class="bashcommand">"</font>) are 
						missing when declaring a string that contains a space. Bellow each erroneous command you can see the error 
						that Bash produces.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<font class="bashcommand">
						$ NAME ="Monica Keith"<br>
						<font class="bashcommand-result">-bash: NAME: command not found</font><br>
						$ NAME= "Monica Keith"<br>
						<font class="bashcommand-result">-bash: Monica Keith: command not found</font><br>
						$ NAME = "Monica Keith"<br>
						<font class="bashcommand-result">-bash: NAME: command not found</font><br>
						$ NAME=Monica Keith<br>
						<font class="bashcommand-result">-bash: Keith: command not found</font>
						</font>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Once you assign a value to a variable, you can reference it with a dollar sign, located immediately before 
						the variable name. You can also reference a variable by including curly brackets 
						(<font class="bashcommand">{}</font>) at the beginning and the end of the variable name. It is better (but 
						not mandatory) to always reference variables using brackets. This will prevent errors in your code (specially 
						when referencing strings that have spaces or special characters).
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<font class="example">Referencing variables</font>
						In the following example, I will declare variable <font class="bashcommand">VAR1</font> with value 
						<font class="bashcommand">2</font>, and variable <font class="bashcommand">VAR2</font> with value 
						<font class="bashcommand">"Subject"</font>. Then, I will use the function 
						<font class="bashcommand">echo</font> to print in the command line the value of the two variables.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<font class="bashcommand">
						$ VAR1=2<br>
						$ VAR2="Subject"<br>
						$ echo ${VAR1}<br>
						<font class="bashcommand-result">2</font><br>
						$ echo ${VAR2}<br>
						<font class="bashcommand-result">Subject</font>
						</font>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<font class="example">Common mistakes when referencing variables</font>
						When referencing a variable, be careful not to include any space before or after the brackets. The following 
						examples will produce an error because of the inclusion of a space around the brackets:
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<font class="bashcommand">
						$ echo ${ VAR2}<br>
						<font class="bashcommand-result">-bash: ${ VAR2}: bad substitution</font><br>
						$ echo ${VAR2 }<br>
						<font class="bashcommand-result">-bash: ${VAR2 }: bad substitution</font><br>
						$ echo ${ VAR2 }<br>
						<font class="bashcommand-result">-bash: ${ VAR2 }: bad substitution</font>
						</font>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The following erroneous reference (with a space between the dollar sign and the first bracket) will not cause 
						an error but will not substitute <font class="bashcommand">${VAR2}</font> for the correct value. It will just 
						print <font class="bashcommand">$ {VAR2}</font> instead of <font class="bashcommand">Subject</font>.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<font class="bashcommand">
						$ echo $ {VAR2}<br>
						$ {VAR2}
						</font>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<font class="example">Concatenating variables</font>
						You can concatenate different variables and characters to form new strings. To do this, you will need to 
						reference the variables using the curly brackets and use quotation marks at the beginning and the end of your 
						final string. For example, if you want to use the previously declared variables 
						<font class="bashcommand">VAR1</font> and <font class="bashcommand">VAR2</font> to generate the String 
						<font class="bashcommand">Subject_02</font>, you can concatenate them the following way:
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<font class="bashcommand">
						$ echo ${VAR2}<br>
						<font class="bashcommand-result">Subject</font><br>
						$ echo ${VAR1}<br>
						<font class="bashcommand-result">2</font><br>
						$ echo "${VAR2}_0${VAR1}"<br>
						<font class="bashcommand-result">Subject_02</font>
						</font>
					</p>
					
					<p>Here are a few more examples on how to declare and concatenate variables:</p>
					
					<p>
						<font class="bashcommand">
						$ ID="Subject_202"<br>
						$ VOLUME=20<br>
						$ MEASURE="mm"<br>
						$ echo "${ID}: ${VOLUME}${MEASURE}"<br>
						<font class="bashcommand-result">Subject_202: 20mm</font>
						</font>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<font class="bashcommand">
						$ VAR1="MacOS"<br>
						$ VAR2="Linux"<br>
						$ VAR3="Windows"<br>
						$ echo "(${VAR1},${VAR2},${VAR3})"<br>
						<font class="bashcommand-result">(MacOS,Linux,Windows)</font>
						</font>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<font class="example">A common mistake when concatenating variables</font>
						It is very common when you are referencing many variables or concatenating variables to create a long string 
						to forget the closing quotation mark. For example, writing<br>
						<font class="bashcommand">$ echo "(${VAR1},${VAR2},${VAR3})</font><br>
						instead of<br>
						<font class="bashcommand">$ echo "(${VAR1},${VAR2},${VAR3})"</font>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						When that happens and you click enter in the keyboard, the command line won't allow you to enter any more 
						commands. You will see the symbol <font class="bashcommand">></font> and if you continue pressing enter it 
						will do nothing. This is because the command line is waiting for you to close the open String. To close the 
						string just add the missing quotation mark or cancel and ignore what you have written so far in the current 
						line by pressing CTR+C.
