# About me

I am a Computer Engineer and Neuroscientist. In neuroscience research, one of the biggest challenges is the amount of computing resources that are needed to run certain experiments and analyze some neuroimaging data. As an engineer, my focus (when I worked in research) was to find better ways to manage these resources so that results can be replicable, reliable and available on time. Now I work at MCW Research Computing Center. Our team is in charge of maintaining the cluster and giving support to the users. This includes (but not limited to) the installation, debugging, parallelization and performance tuning of research software. Managing the scheduler and resource allocation, staff and students accounts, developing training seminars and documentation, etc.
