<h2>1. FSL (Ubuntu)</h2>

<p>You will need administrative privileges in order to install FSL.</p>

<h3>1.1. Download the FSL installer</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Open any web browser and go to the <a href="https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsldownloads_registration" target="_blank">FSL Downloads</a> web page.</li>
	<li>Make sure you click on FSL Software License first, scroll all the way to the bottom and Agree the the license before continuing.</li>
	<li>Fill in the information about yourself and the operating system of the computer where you will be installing FSL. To find out which operating system you have installed, follow these steps:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Open your Terminal application:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Click on the nine dots in the left bottom of the screen. It will show a menu with all the installed applications and a search bar at the top.</li>
			<li>Type Terminal in the search bar.</li>
			<li>Click on the application. The Terminal will open.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Type <code>uname -v</code>. One line of information will be printed which will contain a set of fields separated by spaces. The first field will show your OS version. In my case, this field is <code>#28~22.04.1-Ubuntu</code>. This means that I should select Linux - Ubuntu 22 Jammy as my operating system. If the first field was #99~20.04.1-Ubuntu, you would select Linux - Ubuntu 20 focal as your operating system, etc.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Click Register to register your license. You will now see the link to download the latest version of FSL.</li>
	<li>Click on the link. The download should start automatically. A file called fslinstaller.py will be downloaded to your default download folder which usually is /home/user/Downloads/</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.2. Open your Terminal application if you havent done so (see instrucctions above).</h3>

<h3>1.3. Update all your current packages</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Type <code>sudo apt-get update</code> to update the <u>package list</u> with the latest versions of your programs (does not actually upgrade or install those new versions). You will have to type the administrator password.</li>
	<li>Type <code>apt-get upgrade</code> to upgrade those programs (already installed in your machine) that have new versions available and install the new versions.</li>
	<li>Type <code>Y</code> when prompted for confirmation</li>
	<li>If you get any errors or warnings of packages that were kept back because of any dependencies errors. run <code>sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</code> instead. The previous commmand only upgrades packages that are already installed in your machine. However, if a new version of a program requires other packages that are not yet installed or have been removed for some reason, <code>sudo apt-get upgrade</code> will not update those packages. On the other hand, <code>sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</code> will perform the upgrade and resolve any dependencies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.4. Check your Python installation</h3>
<p>
Make sure that you have Python 3 installed. To do that, type:<br>
<code>python3 --version</code><br>
If you have Python 3 installed, you should see something like this (the exact version will vary but should start with a 3):<br>
<code>Python 3.10.12</code><br>
If Python 3 is <b>not</b> installed, you should see something like this:<br>
<code>-bash: python: command not found</code><br>
And you can install it with the following command:<br>
<code>sudo apt install python3</code>
</p>
<p>Don't worry about having two versions of Python in case you already have Python2. You can always use`python2` to run your python2 scripts and `python3`.</p>

<h3>1.5. Install the software</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Navigate to your downloads directory (or wherever you donwloaded the installation script) by typing `cd ~/Downloads`</li>
	<li>Type: `python3 fslinstaller.py`</li>
	<li>Press enter to install to the default location. Remember this location. It will be needed for the next step when you update your bash profile.</li>
	<li>Provide your password if prompted</li>
	<li>The installation will then a couple of minutes. When done, you should see the following message: FSL successfully installed. If you don't see this message or you get any errors, do NOT continue. You can ask for help in the <a href="https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=fsl" target="_blank">FSL Forum</a>. They are usually very fast to reply, or search in the forum if anybody else has had your same errors during installation. You will have to subscribe to their mailing list to post on the forum. Choose a different email address to your normal one because they sent a lot of emails daily.</li>
	<li>Log out and back in to complete the setup. If you are connected remotely, close your ssh connection and open a new one.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.6. Update your bash profile</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Open your bash profile by typing: `vi ~/.bashrc` or `gedit ~/.bashrc`</li>
	<li>
		Paste the following lines:<br>
		Note: Chage /usr/local/fsl by the location where fsl was installed. For example, if it was installed in your home directory, instead of /usr/local/fsl you will write /home/myuser/fsl<br>
		`FSLDIR=/usr/local/fsl<br>
		. ${FSLDIR}/etc/fslconf/fsl.sh<br>
		PATH=${FSLDIR}/bin:${PATH}<br>
		export FSLDIR PATH`
	</li>
	<li>To reload the bashrc settings type `source ~/.bashrc`</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.7. Check the installation</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Check that your environment is correct by typing: `echo $FSLDIR`. It should show the location you selected during installation.</li>
	<li>Check that your path is correct by typing: `flirt -version`. The output should be: `FLIRT version X.X` (X.X will vary depending on the version you installed)</li>
	<li>Try to open the viewer by typing: `fsleyes`</li>
</ul>
