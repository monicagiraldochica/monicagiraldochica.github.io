	<h3>2.3. Tips for writing scripts</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>
						Albeit not mandatory, the first line of any bash script should be the shebang 
						(<font class="bashcommand">#!/bin/bash</font>). This line indicates that the script is written in bash 
						(instead of tcsh, for example) and that the bash interpreter should execute it.<br><br>
						</li>
						
						<li>
						Be organized when writing scripts. As you start writing longer and more complicated programs, this 
						will become more important. Try to comment as often as possible so that other people can understand what 
						your script is doing, which parameters are needed and what they mean or to understand the output. 
						Commenting will also help you fix errors or keep track of the version, changes, authorship, etc, or to 
						remember what your script does if you don't use it for a while. To insert a comment, you simply start the 
						line with a hash (<font class="bashcommand">#</font>). Any line that starts with this symbol will not be 
						executed (except for the shebang). Also try to use indentation to know where pieces of code start and end 
						(for example when doing loops). If you don't indentate, understanding your own code will be very 
						difficult. Part of being organized is also using appropriate variable names. Use names that are associated 
						to the structure you're using (for example, if you're creating an array, naming it 
						<font class="bashcommand">array</font> will help you remember that this variable is an array and not a 
						string or a number) and try to use short names (for example, instead of naming a variable 
						<font class="bashcommand">myListOfSubjects</font>, you can call it 
						<font class="bashcommand">subjList</font>).</br><br>
						</li>
						
						<li>
						It is also a good idea to use the following commands at the beginning of any script:</br>
						<font class="bashcommand">set -e</font>: This will make the program exit as soon as it encounters an error. 
						If you don't use this, then even if there's an error your code will continue to execute.<br> 
						<font class="bashcommand">set -u</font>: This will make the program exit when using undeclared variables. 
						It will prevent the program from executing the wrong commands if you misspell a variable name.<br><br>
						</li>
						
						<li>
						Use double quotes (<font class="bashcommand">"</font>) when declaring a string, single quotes 
						(<font class="bashcommand">'</font>) when declaring a character, and no quotes when declaring numbers. 
						This will prevent word splitting (when declaring a string that has spaces) and other errors in your 
						code.<br><br>
						</li>
						
						<li>
						Use functions. This topic will be covered in chapter X. Using functions will make your code more readable, 
						reusable, and will allow you to run only parts of the code without having to comment all the lines. This 
						is especially useful when debugging or re-running a script.<br><br>
						</li>
						
						<li>
						If you are declaring a variable that the value should never change, then use the word 
						<font class="bashcommand">readonly</font> before the variable name.<br> 
						For example, if I want to declare a variable called <font class="bashcommand">age</font> with value 
						<font class="bashcommand">30</font> and this value should never be replaced, then you should declare it 
						like this:<br>
						<font class="bashcommand">$ readonly age=30</font><br>
						Instead of:<br>
						<font class="bashcommand">$ age=30</font><br><br>
						
						If at some point in the script you try to replace the value of that variable, you will get an error message:
						<br>
						<font class="bashcommand">$ readonly age=30</font><br>
						<font class="bashcommand">$ age=29</font><br>
						<font class="bashcommand bashcommand-result">-bash: age: readonly variable</font>
						</li>
					</ol>
