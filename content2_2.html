	<h3>2.2. Other editors</h3>	
					<p>
						As I previously mentioned, there is an unlimited number of editors and the choice of which to use is totally 
						personal. The following editors are available for both Linux and MacOS: vim, emacs, gedit (which is also 
						installed by default in Linux and uses a GUI, great for beginners), and Eclipse (among many others). Eclipse 
						is a lot more than an editor; it is a development environment used for programming in many other languages 
						(mainly Java) and for software development and modeling. The following are editors available only for MacOS: 
						Xcode, TextWrangler, TextMate, Notepad++, and Atom (among many others).
