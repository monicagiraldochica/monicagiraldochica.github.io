<h2>3. DSI Studio (Ubuntu)</h2>
<p><b>You will need administrative privileges in order to install DSI Studio.</b></p>
			    	
<h3>3.1. Open your Terminal application if you havent done so.</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Click on the nine dots in the left bottom of the screen. It will show a menu with all the installed applications and a search bar at the top.</li>
	<li>Type Terminal in the search bar.</li>
	<li>Click on the application. The Terminal will open.</li>
</ul>
			    	
<h3>3.2. Update all your current packages</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Type <code>sudo apt-get update</code> to update the <u>package list</u> with the latest versions of your programs (does not actually upgrade or install those new versions). You will have to type the administrator password.</li>
	<li>Type <code>apt-get upgrade</code> to upgrade those programs (already installed in your machine) that have new versions available and install the new versions.</li>
	<li>Type <code>Y</code> when prompted for confirmation</li>
	<li>If you get any errors or warnings of packages that were kept back because of any dependencies errors. run <code>sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</code> instead. The previous commmand only upgrades packages that are already installed in your machine. However, if a new version of a program requires other packages that are not yet installed or have been removed for some reason, <code>sudo apt-get upgrade</code> will not update those packages. On the other hand, <code>sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</code> will perform the upgrade and resolve any dependencies.</li>
</ul>
					
<h3>3.3 Find out the version of the Operating System installed in your machine</h3>
<p>Type <code>uname -v</code>. One line of information will be printed which will contain a set of fields separated by spaces. The first field will show your OS version. In my case, this field is <code>#28~22.04.1-Ubuntu</code>. This means that I have Ubuntu 22 as my operating system. If the first field was <code>#99~20.04.1-Ubuntu</code>, you have Ubuntu 20 as your operating system, etc.</p>
				
<h3>3.4. Install all the dependency packages</h3>
<p>You could install all of the packages below in a single command but I prefer to install them separately in case one of them has a dependency that is not installed in my computer. To install all at the same time, list all the packages name separated by a space after the word <code>install</code>. Either way, install first g++ and gcc before installing the others.</p>
<p>If you cannot install g++-5 ot gcc-5 (For Ubuntu versions later than 16.04) try installing g++ and gcc</p>
<ul><code>
	<li>sudo apt install g++-5</li>
	<li>sudo apt install gcc-5</li>
	<li>sudo apt install git</li>
	<li>sudo apt install libboost-all-dev</li>
	<li>sudo apt install zlib1g</li>
	<li>sudo apt install zlib1g-dev</li>
</code></ul>
<p>If you have problems installing the dependencies, you might have to use DSI Studio through a <a href="#singularity">singularity container</a> or on a <a href="#ubuntu16">virtual machine with Ubuntu 16.04</a>. Follow the corresponding instructions for each option</p>
			    	
<h3>3.5. Download and install Qt 5.12.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Navigate to the folder where you want download the installer. For example, the Downloads folder: <code>cd ~/Downloads/</code></li>
	<li>Download the installer: <code>wget http://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.12/5.12.8/qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.12.8.run</code></li>
	<li>Change the permissions of the installation file so it can be executed: <code>chmod 775 qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.12.8.run</code></li>
	<li>Execute the installer: <code>./qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.12.8.run</code>. You will need access to the computer screen (instead of a ssh connection) because this will open an installation GUI.</li>
	<li>If you get a warning about the Qt account settings file missing, it's ok, it will be created once you log in or create an account. Check that the file was actually created after the installation (If you get the warning, it will show the expected path of the file).</li>
	<li>Login to your Qt Account or sign up for one when prompted, and accept the service terms</li>
	<li>Check your email and verify your Qt account before clicking Next</li>
	<li>Follow the instructions of the installer. When prompted to select the components, select all of them</li>
	<li>Write down the folder where Qr5.12.8 was installed (the information will be provided to you during installation) because you will need to remember it in the next section</li>
	<li>You can close the Qt application if it launches</li>
	<li>Re-run the commands from section 2.1. in case there is a new version of Qt available or of any of the dependencies installed in section 2.2.</li>
</ul>
			    	
<h3>3.6. Download the DSI Studio installer</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Create a working directory where the installation files will be saved. For example, in your home directory: <code>mkdir /home/myuser/dsistudio</code></li>
	<li>Navigate into the directory that you just created: <code>cd /home/myuser/dsistudio</code></li>
	<li>Download the source code of DSI Studio from Github: <code>git clone -b master git://github.com/frankyeh/DSI-Studio.git src</code></li>
	<li>A folder called src should now appear in your current directory. To check type <code>ls</code>. This will show the list of files in your current directory.</li>
	<li>Create the following subdirectory inside the src folder: <code>mkdir src/tipl</code></li>
	<li>Download frankyeh-TIPL zip folder: <code>xdg-open https://github.com/frankyeh/TIPL/zipball/master</code></li>
	<li>Move the downloaded zip file to the tipl folder we just created if downloaded elsewhere</li>
	<li>Navigate to that directory: <code>cd src/tipl</code></li>
	<li>Unzip the zip file: <code>unzip frankyeh-TIPL-2020_07-0-g8eb8d76.zip</code>. The actual file name will vary depending on when/what version you download.</li>
	<li>Move all the contents of the unzipped folder to the current directory (src/tipl): <code>mv frankyeh-TIPL-8eb8d76/* .</code></li>
	<li>Remove the zip and unzipped (which now should be empty) files: <code>rm -r frankyeh-TIPL-2020_07-0-g8eb8d76.zip frankyeh-TIPL-8eb8d76</code></li>
</ul>
			    	
<h3>3.7. Compile</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Go back to your DSI studio folder: <code>cd /home/myuser/dsistudio</code></li>
	<li>Create a directory to build and compile: <code>mkdir build</code></li>
	<li>Navigate to that directory: <code>cd build</code></li>
	<li>Execute qmake, which is installed in the Qt5.12.5 directory (and I wrote above to remember its path). i.e. if my installation folder for Qt5 is /home/myuser/Qt5.12.8, then this is the command I would run to execute qmake: <code>$ /home/myuser/Qt5.12.8/5.12.8/gcc_64/bin/qmake ../src</code></li>
	<li>You should see something like this: <code>Info: creating stash file /home/myuser/dsistudio/build/.qmake.stash</code></li>
	<li>Compile: <code">make</code></li>
	<ul>
		<li>Wait until it finishes compiling. This could take several few minutes. If everything goes well, you should find dsi_studio under build directory (Which should be the current directory). To check type <code>ls dsi_studio</code>. You should get: <code>dsi-studio</code>. If there was an error in the installation, you will get something like this: <code>ls: cannot access 'dsi_studio': No such file or directory</code>. If this happens, do <b>not</b> continue with the installation, check the previous steps. Did you get any error running a previous step? Did you get a message of some package or dependency that needs to be installed? Any error should be fixed right away or the installation wont be completed successfully.</li>
		<li>If you have an Ubuntu version higher than Ubuntu 16, there is a high chance that you will have problems compiling dsi_studio. If you didn't have any errors in the previous steps and are not missing any package or dependency that needs to be installed but still get compiling errors, you will have to use a singularity container to run dsi_studio. You will get an error in the Makefile when compiling, something like this: <code>error: *** [Makefile:11814: RegionModel.o] Error 1</code>. In that case, skip the following sections and jump to <a href="#singularity">5.9. Using DSI Studio through a singularity container.</a> and follow the instructions.</li>
		<li>If that still fails (dsi_studio has many issues running on Linux), try <a href="#ubuntu16">installing dsi_studio on a virtual machine with Ubuntu 16.04</a></li>
	</ul>
	<li>If you were able to compile dsi_studio, remove unnecessary files: <code>make clean</code> and continue to section 5.6.</li>
</ul>
			    	
<h3 id="atlas">3.8. Download the atlas files from the Windows installer</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Go back to the dsistudio directory: <code>cd ..</code></li>
	<li>Download the Windows installer from one of the following locations:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByehavN7OmC7MlVHVTgyVFBNQmc" target="_blank">DSI Studio Google Drive folder</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/oofozwq3toyh2m4/dsi_studio_64.zip?dl=0" target="_blank">DSI Studio Dropbox folder</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://pitt.box.com/v/dsi-studio-win" target="_blank">DSI Studio Box folder</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ap9BQsu66jeblKEayFJqQRB7WL0OEw?e=Z0A7sX" target="_blank">DSI Studio One Drive folder</a></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Move into the current directory (dsistudio) if downloaded elsewhere</li>
	<li>Unzip the file: <code>unzip dsi_studio_64.zip</code></li>
	<li><core>cd dsi_studio_64</code></li>
	<li>Remove unnecessary files (that are for Windows):
		<ul><code>
		    <li>find . -name '*.dll' -exec rm {} \;</li>
		    <li>rmdir iconengines imageformats platforms styles</li>
		    <li>rm dsi_studio.exe vc_redist.x64.exe</li>
		    <li>rm ../dsi_studio_64.zip</li>
		</code></ul>
	</li>
	<li>Move the DSI Studio executable into the current directory: <code>cp ../build/dsi_studio .</code></li>
</ul>
			    	
<h3>3.9. Check the installation</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Try to run DSI Studio from the terminal: <code>$ ./dsi_studio</code></li>
	<li>If the installation finished successfully, the application should open. If you get an error saying dsi_studio not found. Try writing the full path to the dsi_studio executable. For example: <code">/home/user/dsi_studio/dsi_studio</code></li>
</ul>
					
<h3>3.10. Potential errors during installation</h3>
<p>It's not uncommon to run into issues while installing DSI Studio. I could not possibly describe all the possible problems you could run into but here are a few examples of errors I have run into and how I solved them:</p>
	<h4><code>N: Skipping acquire of configured file 'main/binary-i386/Packages' as repository 'https://download.mono-project.com/repo/ubuntu stable-focal InRelease' doesn't support architecture 'i386'</code> while upgrading or updating your packages</h4>
	<p>In this example the error occured when updating the mono package. But it could happen for any other package. To solve the issue, I typed the following commands. Replace the list file for the one corresponding to the package you are having issues with.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Type <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/</code> and look for the .list file corresponding to the problematic repository. In my case it was: mono-official-stable.list</li>
	<li>Type <code>sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mono-official-stable.list</code>. You can replace gedit by <code>vi</code> or <code>nano</code> or you favorite editor.</li>
	<li>
		The file should contain one line that starts with the word <code>deb</code> and contains the https address from the error you got when updating your packages. Place <code>[arch=amd64]</code> between <code>deb</code> and the http address.<br>
		For me, this is how the like look before the edits:<br>
		<code>deb https://download.mono-project.com/repo/ubuntu stable-focal main</code><br>
		And this is how it looked after the edits:
		<code>deb [arch=amd64] https://download.mono-project.com/repo/ubuntu stable-focal main</code>
	</li>
	<li>Re-run the update or upgrade command that gave the error</li>
</ul>
					
<h3 id="singularity">3.11. Using DSI Studio through a singularity container</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Check if you have Docker installed in your computer. And install it if you don't.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>To check if you have Docker installed, type <code>docker --version</code> in the command line.</li>
		<li>If Docker is already installed, you will see something like this (will differ depending on your version): <code>Docker version 19.03.13, build cd8016b6bc</code></li>
		<li>If it is not installed, you will get an error saying command not found. In that case, follow the instructions in this <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/">link</a> to install Docker.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Once docker is installed, enable the NeuroDebian repository following the instructions in the <a href="http://neuro.debian.net/">NeuroDebian web site</a>. Choose your operating system. If you are not a cluster administrator and are just installing the software for a single user in one machine, choose the option "only software with guaranteed freedoms". Then, you will see a list of commands that you have to copy paste in your command line.</li>
	<li>Install singularity: <code>sudo apt-get install -y singularity-container</code>. If you have a previously installed configuration, you might be asked the type of configuration that you want. For a single user, choose the one by default. Check the <a href="https://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-config">admin docs</a> for cluster admins.</li>
	<li>Check that singularity was correctly installed: <code>singularity --version</code>. You should see the singularity version.</li>
	<li>Create the dsi_studio image file:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Type <code>singularity pull docker://dsistudio/dsistudio</code> in the command line</li>
		<li>The path and file name of the dsi_studio image will be printed. Save this path, because you will need it to run dsi_studio commands.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Open the dsi_studio GUI:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Type the following command, replacing <code>/home/user/dsistudio.simg</code> by the path were the dsi_studio image is saved: <code>singularity exec /home/user/dsistudio.simg dsi_studio</code></li>
		<li>If that still fails (dsi_studio has many issues running on Linux), try <a href="#ubuntu16">installing dsi_studio on a virtual machine with Ubuntu 16.04</a></li>
		<li>If it worked, go to section <a href="#atlas">5.6. Download the atlas files from the Windows installer</a></li>
		<li>Go to step 5.1. again and try installing DSI Studio on your virtual machine</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
